## Your Content & Conduct

Our Service allows you and other users to sign into a matchmaking system using your Discord user ID.

When you sign, you grant us the right and license to use and share your user name with other users where pso-matchmaker is installed.

Your Discord user ID is saved in our database in order to know how many times you signed into the matchmaking system, so we can provide a minimalist ranking system in the matchmaking.
