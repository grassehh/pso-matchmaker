         **Creating** a **Lineup** is the next step after creating your **Team**.
         A Lineup is associated with the Discord channel where it was created.
         To **create** a **Lineup**, simply use the */setup_lineup* command, and give it a size.

         You can also specify a name to your **Lineup**. This can be useful if you have multiple **Lineups** within you server, having the same size.
         You can enable the auto_search option if you want your **Lineup** to automatically register into the queue, and notify the other teams that you are looking for a match.
         
         Finally, if you wish to **delete** your **Lineup** for any reason, use the /delete_lineup command.

         *(calling the /setup_lineup command multiple time will override the existing lineup setup)*

      A **Mix Lineup** is a lineup where 2 mix teams can sign into the same channel. A mix can also be challenged by a **Team**. When this happens, only the first mix team will face them.
      To **create** a **Mix Lineup**, use the */setup_mix* command, and give it a size.

      **Mix Lineup** don't have an "auto_search" option because they are always in the queue by default (if their visibility is set to 'public')

            - **/register_team**

            - **/team_name**

            By Default, the Discord server administrator has access to all of these commands. If you wish to give someone else's permission for these commands, create a role named **'PSO MM ADMIN'** and give them.
